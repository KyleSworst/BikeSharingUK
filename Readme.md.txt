This is my First project Using Data from "Kaggle" The Data is "Bike Sharing London" The Goal was to find the most optimal time

Identified ideal climate with the lowest and highest bike sharing rates in the UK, quantified number of participants throughout the day, 
and identified average bike sharing by season; published a Tableau dashboard to track KPIs. 

People are willing to rent a bike, the season with most bike rentals, and how weather can affect
The rate at which people are willing to use or not use a bike.

Using SQL I made Changes to the data to get a clearer understanding of the data and what it represents. to prove or disprove my hypothesis.

My Hypothesis - The Optimum Condition To Cycle In Is “NOT” On A Holiday, But  On  A Weekend, During Spring, With Clear Weather.

Imported Data Changes Over to Tableu For Data Visualization.
