This is my First project Using Data from "Kaggle" The Data is "Bike Sharing London" The Goal was to find the most optimal time

People are willing to rent a bike, the season with most bike rentals, and how weather can affect
The rate at which people are willing to use or not use a bike.

Using SQL I made Changes to the data to get a clearer understanding of the data and what it represents. to prove or disprove my hypothesis.

My Hypothesis - The Optimum Condition To Cycle In Is “NOT” On A Holiday, But  On  A Weekend, During Spring, With Clear Weather.

Imported Data Changes Over to Tableu For Data Visualization.
